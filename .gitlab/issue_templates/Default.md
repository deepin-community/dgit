Please do not file any new issues here.

Instead, file Debian Bug Tracking System bugs.

This allows us to organise things by binary package,
though feel free to report against src:dgit if in any doubt.

Merge requests on salsa remain very welcome.

(We cannot make the issues tracker read-only without disabling it
completely, which would break links to comments in closed issues.)
