=head1 NAME

git-deborig - try to produce Debian orig.tar using git-archive(1)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<git deborig> [B<--force>|B<-f>] [B<--just-print>|B<--just-print-tag-names>] [B<--version=>I<VERSION>] [I<COMMITTISH>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<git-deborig> tries to produce the orig.tar you need for your upload
by calling git-archive(1) on an existing git tag or branch head.  It
was written with the dgit-maint-merge(7) workflow in mind, but can be
used with other workflows.

B<git-deborig> will try several common tag names.  If this fails, or
if more than one of those common tags are present, you can specify the
tag or branch head to archive on the command line (I<COMMITTISH> above).

B<git-deborig> will override gitattributes(5) that would cause the
contents of the tarball generated by git-archive(1) not to be
identical with the commitish archived: the B<export-subst> and
B<export-ignore> attributes.

B<git-deborig> should be invoked from the root of the git repository,
which should contain I<debian/changelog>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-f>|B<--force>

Overwrite any existing orig.tar in the parent directory.

=item B<--just-print>

Instead of actually invoking git-archive(1), output information about
how it would be invoked.  Ignores I<--force>.

Note that running the git-archive(1) invocation outputted with this
option may not produce the same output.  This is because
B<git-deborig> takes care to disables git attributes otherwise heeded
by git-archive(1), as detailed above.

=item B<--just-print-tag-names>

Instead of actually invoking git-archive(1), or even checking which
tags exist, print the tag names we would consider for the upstream
version number in the first entry in the Debian changelog, or that
supplied with B<--version>.

=item B<--version=>I<VERSION>

Instead of reading the new upstream version from the first entry in
the Debian changelog, use I<VERSION>.
