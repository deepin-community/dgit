Description: client script for git pushing to Debian-style archives
 git-debpush is a script to create and push a specially formatted
 signed git tag.  The metadata in the tag indicates that the tagged
 commit should be pushed (or "uploaded") to a Debian-style archive.
 .
 Tags generated by this script can be read by an intermediary service,
 which performs any conversion that's needed (such as producing and
 signing a .dsc and .changes), and then uploads the result to the
 Debian-style archive on your behalf.
